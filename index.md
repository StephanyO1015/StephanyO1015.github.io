## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2 
Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs because I got to download Linux and begin my computer journey since I had never worked with any type of coding. I also had the chance to connect with classmates and professors. This lab really helped me communicate and work together with others.

* Lab 8 Part 1
Lab 8 was my first lab back after my injury, so I was worried I would feel really lost. To my surprise, I understood most of it. I finished most of part 1, and even though we stayed about 30 minutes after the lab ended, the extra time helped me understand the material better. Overall, this lab made me feel more confident about catching up.

* Lab 10 Part 2 
Lab 10 was one of my favorites because even though we were confused, we worked through each part together. We helped each other, and since some of us understood certain parts better, we filled each other in. It felt good to learn as a team and support one another. This lab really showed me how important teamwork is.
